        When Scrooge awoke it was so dark, that, looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened for the hour.

        He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped. <q>Why, it isn’t possible,</q> said Scrooge, <q>that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!</q>

        The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This was a great relief, because <q>Three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,</q> and so forth, would have become a mere United States security if there were no days to count by.
